<p> Hi guys, I'm Josh and I am 21 and from Chesapeake, Virginia. Before coming here I was a Toyota Technician for the last 3 years. 
I went to Advanced Technical Institute and received my Associates of Science in Automotive Technology with Service Managment.
I am pursueing a Bachelors in Software Engineering and my desired career path is to become a Blockchain Developer.
I would love to be able to write proficient code in the Solidity language but I would have to learn the works of html,
css, and Javascript before I begin that route. I want to get the most out of my education to be able to use it to my advantage in landing my dream job. 
I love to surf every sunday at the beach, skate with friends, go off-roading, 
work on my project cars, workout, and play videogames. Lets all have a great semester together!  </p>
